Summary





Gratitude and Triple a Emergency: AI Dev Call

Paige welcomed everyone to the meeting and mentioned an emergency event
scheduled on the triple A related to the open AI dev call that people
should attend. The meeting then focused on gratitude, with participants
sharing what they were grateful for, including their work on AI, the
Renaissance period, and their energy levels. Paige also mentioned that she
was grateful for the amount of energy she has felt recently and the
opportunity to work on AI.


Project Management Clarity and Vision Statement Review

Paige reminded the team of an open submission for their project and
highlighted the need for clarity on how the project will be managed,
including questions about lead management and marketing strategies. With
only 24 hours left for submission, Paige encouraged team members to share
their ideas and plans in a vote that will be conducted over the weekend.
Paige also discussed the process of moderator rotations and asked for ideas
on how this could work. Lastly, Paige shared the team's mission and vision
statements, emphasizing personal and collective growth, and asked for any
additional thoughts or feedback.


Mission, Vision, and AI Ethics

Paige led a discussion about the company's mission and vision. The team
agreed to emphasize ease of implementation and ethical practices in their
AI solutions. They also discussed the need for education to help clients
feel comfortable with AI. The vision statement, which aimed to shape an
interconnected world through advanced AI solutions and collaborative
spirit, catalyzing growth, inspiring continuous learning, and redefining
the essence of work and success, was deemed unclear by Bianca. The team
decided to work on clarifying the vision statement.


Task Automation & Personal Growth

Narakeru discussed how the team handles mundane and repetitive tasks for
businesses, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects and growth.
Alejo confirmed the understanding of Narakeru's statement and Paige added
that they are using AI for the tedious tasks. Bartek emphasized the
importance of personal growth and continuous learning, which Paige agreed
with. The discussion ended with Paige asking Silviu to share her thoughts.


Mission, Vision, and Financial Goals

Silviu, Paige, and their team discussed their organization's mission,
vision, and financial goals. Bianca suggested reframing the focus on money
as an internal goal, while Alejo stressed the need for a tangible plan to
reach their revenue goal. The team decided to focus on their mission and
vision for now and planned to discuss short-term and long-term goals, as
well as KPIs, in future meetings. Bianca proposed a lead magnet concept for
individual companies, which Paige agreed could be developed into a media
outlet or education for profitability. The team asked everyone to clarify
their understanding of the plan on Figma for further discussion.


Facebook Group for Non-Winning Clients

Paige and Bartek discussed the possibility of creating a Facebook group for
potential clients who did not win a giveaway. Bartek suggested that the
group could be used to distribute $1,000 in automation weekly and allow
agencies to pick up the clients. Paige found the idea promising and
encouraged Bartek to develop it further. Furthermore, Paige announced that
the next meeting would focus on presenting ideas and elected two advocates
from the dev team and the marketing and sales team each to facilitate
communication between the operations hub and the dev team.
