## Summary
### Project Pivot: Automation, Innovation, and AI Solutions
Henry led a discussion to pivot the project from Mike's competition idea, leading the team to brainstorm a new direction focused on deploying automation as a catalyst for life enhancement and efficiency, fostering an inclusive space for innovation, and shaping an interconnected world with advanced AI solutions. The team also decided to come up with a new name and planned a breakout session led by Paige to brainstorm and decide on a roadmap for their project. The team also discussed the importance of acquiring their first paid client and ways to market their services, with Paige suggesting the development of cohesive proposals from previous marketing meetings.

### Accelerator Plan: Gathering Diverse Opinions for Comprehensive Strategy
Paige and Alejo discussed the organization's accelerator plan, with Paige opening rooms for further discussion. Alejo emphasized the importance of gathering diverse opinions and skills to create a comprehensive strategy for their first paid client. Several participants shared their ideas, and Alejo ensured the meeting would not exceed an hour to prevent burnout. The team decided to continue discussions in the next meeting.

### Marketing Research for Multiple Clients
Silviu led the discussion on marketing research to identify pain points for each niche and suggested creating a product that fits multiple companies. Alejo struggled with sharing screen, and Paige summarized the discussion points. Silviu advocated for personal connections to find leads and clients. The team also considered creating a software that fits multiple clients with slight adaptations. Luka asked if they were limited to English-speaking businesses, and Alejo clarified that as long as their needs were well-communicated, they could handle any language. Luka also raised a question about creating chatbots in different languages.

### Marketing Strategies for AI Solutions
Alejo led a discussion with Henry, Paige, Paavaan, and Marc about marketing strategies. Paavaan suggested creating content, leveraging social media platforms, and connecting with decision makers to reach potential clients. Alejo asked Marc to bring his idea to the marketing meeting. The meeting also focused on the structuring of a group combining subject matter experts from various agencies to leverage social proof and establish credibility. The group aims to educate businesses about AI and find the ideal client base that is knowledgeable about current technologies but unable to implement themselves. The marketing strategy includes content creation, education, and paid advertising, with a focus on building social proof and establishing the group as industry experts. The group differentiates itself from others by offering business solutions using AI, rather than just AI automation. Procedures for scaling the business quickly, such as standard operating procedures for sales and onboarding, were also discussed.

### Forming Small Marketing Groups for Lead Magnets
Jorg discussed the plan to form smaller groups within the marketing team to create lead magnets, or social proof, to improve the team's output. Henry expressed confusion about the structure of these groups, but Jorg clarified that each group would focus on a specific aspect of social media or lead generation. The team agreed that this approach would allow them to create more valuable content and grow faster. Alejo added that the development team had already started implementing a similar structure. Paige then briefly touched on the need for devops and security ops as the company scales, as well as identifying niches for their work.

### Progress, Structure, and Collaboration
Henry led a discussion about the team's progress and the organization's structure, considering whether to operate as a startup or collaborate with agencies. He initially expressed concerns about having too many contributors, but later saw value in the learning experience. He proposed the group act as an incubator for learning and collaboration, and discussed the pros and cons of smaller versus larger group projects with Ahmed. Henry emphasized the importance of establishing a strong company structure to prepare for potential large projects and acknowledged the marketing team's progress. Silviu and others highlighted the benefits of collaborative work, citing efficiency and personal growth as key advantages. Alejo and JFK echoed these sentiments, with Alejo noting personal skill development and JFK comparing the group to a risk-sharing investment with potential for a successful business.

### Increasing KA & Fake MVP Method Discussion
John F. Kennedy, Alejo, Pawel, and others discussed the possibility of increasing the number of KA per month. Pawel suggested using a 'fake MVP' method to test value propositions before building anything and organizing an international study on AI Automation adoption in corporations worldwide. Alejo agreed with both ideas and showed interest in pursuing them. The team also discussed breaking down a large international survey into smaller, more manageable sections called "value bonds" and creating a temporary spin-off to advocate for adopting AI. The team agreed to explore the idea of forming an actual DAO and doing an ICO. Alejo thanked everyone for their participation and Henry announced a voting form for the team to choose a name.
