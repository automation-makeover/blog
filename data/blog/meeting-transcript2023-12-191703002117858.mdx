CBRE Forecasts Initial Signs of Revitalization in 2024

Anticipating an economic deceleration in 2024, CBRE predicts a downward shift in real estate transaction values, with the burgeoning potential for buying opportunities. However, the likelihood of a recession is correspondingly low, as per the companyâ€™s analysis provided in the 2024 U.S. Real Estate Outlook. The economists at CBRE project that the robust consumer spending behavior will counterbalance the anticipated economic challenges next year, which includes high-interest rates and approaching economic slowdown.

The acclaimed real estate services company highlights the importance of a resilient consumer market. This predicted strength in consumer spending, they believe, will be instrumental in mitigating the financial turbulence brought about by these potential economic headwinds. Through an assessment of current and future market trends, the team of economists at CBRE is confident that steady consumer spending will serve as a buffer against such unfavorable economic conditions.

Under this scenario, real estate transaction values are forecasted to decline further in 2024. However, CBRE's outlook suggests that this could signal compelling buying opportunities for prospective investors and real estate companies. This decline in property transaction values could pave the way for increased activity in the real estate market, with players keen to leverage the predicted chaote regime.

Therefore, the company's 2024 U.S. Real Estate Outlook holds a positive perspective for the real estate market, despite predicting an economic slowdown. By projecting the "Early Stages of Recovery," CBRE emphasizes the potential for progress and growth in 2024 due to the envisaged robust consumer spending and ensuing real estate buying opportunities.
